# Banglore-Traffic-Analysis
Using Python and libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, I analyzed a pre-cleaned Kaggle traffic dataset to extract key insights.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) revealed Wednesdays have the highest traffic, Fridays the lowest, and June records peak congestion, while January sees the least. An inverse relationship exists between traffic volume and average speed, with Koramangala being the most congested and Electronic City the least due to better parking availability and pedestrian activity. Sony World Junction and Sarjapur Road are major congestion hotspots.Regression Analysis was performed to predict congestion levels, achieving an R² score of 0.914, indicating a strong fit. The analysis showed that Travel Time Index has the most significant positive impact on congestion, while Public Transport Usage slightly reduces congestion levels. Traffic Volume and Road Capacity Utilization also have moderate positive effects.
